          Several doubts about the accuracy of the memoir written by the Chevalier de Seingalt are raised in the reading, but the professor clarifies the seeming contradictions in the Chevalier's accounts to defend the memoir. The professor explains that the Chevalier was rich in assets, but poor in cash, while he lived in Switzerland and had to occasionally borrow funds while waiting for his assets to be sold. According to the professor, being low on cash is not the same as being financially poor. However, in reading, someone who borrows large amounts of money could not be wealthy, therefore the Chevalier must have lied about his wealthy life in Switzerland. The skepticism regarding the reliability of the recorded conversations with Voltaire is challenged by the professor as well. She explains that, due to the habit of recording each conversation with Voltaire immediately afterward, the Chevalier was able to recall those discussions in detail even after several years had passed. Finally, the professor refutes the idea that bribery was how the Chevalier got out of prison. She points out that because even the other prisoners who had better resources were unable to successfully bribe their way out of prison, it was very unlikely that bribery was how he escaped. Also, she notes the existence of government papers recording repair work done to the Chevalier's prison cell ceiling as strong evidence that his escape from the prison was accurately recorded.
